Welcome to **Tonion** blog, we are exited to announce the starting the work of Tonion team on a new TON development toolkit.

# What is Tonion?

The Tonion is a toolkit for [TON](https://ton.org) development using [TACT](https://tact-lang.org) programming language. Tonion has a active development team who maintains the toolkit and supports it. We are aiming to do what [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com) previously did on Ethereum using Solidity. Tonion toolkit is fully open-source and non-profit and it's basically backed by the [Dezh Technologies](https://dezh.tech).

# Why Tonion?

At the Dezh technologies we are working on DApps and Decentralized platforms to form the future of a real decentralized web. we find ourselves developing apps using FunC on TON and later we find a way more easy and fast path to our goals on TON called Tact, after our journey on Tact we find that there are no good toolkit and references, our more development tools, we decided to share the codes we mostly use in form of reference implementation and make them better day by day. We continued this work by adding more stuff such as development tools, and ... to our roadmap.

# Future?

We have plans to expand our toolkit and add more utils, we are planing to implement all possible standards, provide tools to use them easy and fast and add audit and reviews for a safe use. You can find documents in this website and later you can find full courses and step by step tutorials in this blog, so don't forget to check it later or just subscribe to our [Telegram](https://t.me/toniondev) channel right now to don'r miss anything new.
